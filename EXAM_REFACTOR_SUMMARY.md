# Exam Session Frontend Refactor Summary

## Overview
The exam session frontend has been successfully refactored to match the UX specification in `exam-session-ux.md`. Each exam step now has its own dedicated page with proper route protection.

## New Page Structure

### 1. Entry/Configuration Page
**Route:** `/exams/[examId]`
**File:** `src/app/(exams)/exams/[examId]/page.tsx`

**Purpose:**
- Entry point for all exams (NOT protected - this is the starting point)
- Displays configuration screen for practice/test exams
- Auto-redirects to instructions for recruitment/competition/challenge exams

**Flow:**
1. Checks for active session → redirects to session page if found
2. Validates exam access via `checkExamAccess()`
3. If exam requires config (practice/test) → shows configuration form
4. If exam doesn't require config (recruitment/competition/challenge) → redirects to instructions
5. On config completion → navigates to instructions page with config in URL params

---

### 2. Instructions Page
**Route:** `/exams/[examId]/instructions`
**File:** `src/app/(exams)/exams/[examId]/instructions/page.tsx`

**Protection:** ✅ Protected
- Validates exam access via `checkExamAccess()`
- Checks for active session (redirects if found)
- Requires invitation token for recruitment/competition/challenge exams

**Purpose:**
- Displays exam instructions and anti-cheat warnings
- Shows exam configuration details
- Provides pre-exam checklist

**Flow:**
1. Loads instructions via `getExamInstructions()`
2. Parses config from URL params (for practice/test)
3. On "Start Exam" → calls `startExamSession()` to create session
4. After session created → navigates to `/exams/[examId]/session/[sessionId]`

---

### 3. Active Exam Session Page
**Route:** `/exams/[examId]/session/[sessionId]`
**File:** `src/app/(exams)/exams/[examId]/session/[sessionId]/page.tsx`

**Protection:** ✅ Strongly Protected
- Validates session exists via `validateActiveSession()`
- Ensures session belongs to current user
- Confirms session status is "active"
- Auto-redirects to results if session is completed
- Auto-redirects to entry page if session is abandoned/expired

**Purpose:**
- Renders the active exam interface
- Manages question navigation, answer submission, and anti-cheat monitoring

**Flow:**
1. Validates session on mount
2. Renders `ExamInterfaceV2` component
3. On exam complete → navigates to `/exams/[examId]/results/[sessionId]`
4. On exam abandon → navigates back to `/exams/[examId]`

---

### 4. Results Page
**Route:** `/exams/[examId]/results/[sessionId]`
**File:** `src/app/(exams)/exams/[examId]/results/[sessionId]/page.tsx`

**Protection:** ✅ Strongly Protected
- Validates session exists via `validateCompletedSession()`
- Ensures session belongs to current user
- Confirms session status is "completed"
- Auto-redirects to session page if still active
- Auto-redirects to entry page if abandoned/expired

**Purpose:**
- Displays exam results and performance breakdown
- Shows detailed question review for practice mode
- Provides retake and dashboard navigation options

**Flow:**
1. Validates completed session on mount
2. Loads results via `getExamResults()`
3. Renders appropriate results based on exam category
4. On retake → navigates to `/exams/[examId]`
5. On back to dashboard → navigates to `/dashboard`

---

## Protection Utilities

### File: `src/lib/utils/exam-route-guards.ts`

#### `validateActiveSession(sessionId: string)`
- Checks if session exists, belongs to user, and is active
- Returns redirect path if validation fails
- Used by session page

#### `validateCompletedSession(sessionId: string)`
- Checks if session exists, belongs to user, and is completed
- Returns redirect path if validation fails
- Used by results page

#### `getActiveSession(examId: string)`
- Finds any active session for an exam
- Used to prevent multiple concurrent sessions
- Used by entry and instructions pages

---

## Server Actions

### New Action: `getSessionInfo(sessionId: string)`
**File:** `src/lib/actions/get-session-info.ts`

**Purpose:** Retrieves session information for resuming an existing session
**Returns:**
- Session ID, exam ID, start time, end time
- Total questions, question order
- Time limit and exam type

---

## Hook Updates

### Updated: `useExamSession()`
**File:** `src/hooks/use-exam-session.ts`

**New Method:** `resumeSession(sessionId: string)`
- Allows resuming an existing session (not creating a new one)
- Loads session info from server
- Initializes session state and starts time sync
- Used by ExamInterfaceV2 when navigating to session page

---

## Component Updates

### Updated: `ExamInterfaceV2`
**File:** `src/components/exams/exam-interface-v2.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Now properly uses `sessionId` prop (no longer ignored)
- Calls `resumeSession()` on mount to load existing session
- Initializes from existing session instead of requiring new session creation

---

## Navigation Flow Examples

### Practice/Test Mode (Self-Selection)
```
1. User → /exams/[examId]
2. Shows configuration screen
3. User configures → /exams/[examId]/instructions?config=[...]
4. Shows instructions
5. User clicks start → Creates session → /exams/[examId]/session/[sessionId]
6. User completes exam → /exams/[examId]/results/[sessionId]
7. User clicks retake → Back to step 1
```

### Recruitment/Competition/Challenge (Direct Link)
```
1. User → /exams/[examId]?token=[invitationToken]
2. Auto-redirects → /exams/[examId]/instructions?token=[invitationToken]
3. Shows instructions
4. User clicks start → Creates session → /exams/[examId]/session/[sessionId]
5. User completes exam → /exams/[examId]/results/[sessionId]
6. Shows limited results (score only)
```

## Route Protection Summary

| Route | Protection Level | Redirect Conditions |
|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| `/exams/[examId]` | ❌ Not Protected | Entry point; redirects if active session exists |
| `/exams/[examId]/instructions` | ✅ Access Check | Requires valid exam access; redirects if active session |
| `/exams/[examId]/session/[sessionId]` | ✅ Session Active | Requires active session; redirects if completed/abandoned |
| `/exams/[examId]/results/[sessionId]` | ✅ Session Completed | Requires completed session; redirects if active |

---

## Compliance with UX Specification

✅ **Pre-Exam Configuration** (Test/Practice Only)
- Dedicated configuration page at `/exams/[examId]`
- Settings for questions count, shuffle, time limit
- Validation for test mode time limit requirement

✅ **Instructions Page**
- Separate instructions page for all exam types
- Displays exam type, time limit, shuffle status
- Shows anti-cheat warnings for strict modes
- Pre-exam checklist

✅ **Separate Pages per Step**
- Entry/Config, Instructions, Session, Results each have dedicated pages
- Clean URL structure reflecting exam flow
- State isolation between steps

✅ **Route Protection**
- Entry page is not protected (as specified)
- All other pages have appropriate protection
- Automatic redirects based on session state

✅ **Session Management**
- Prevents multiple concurrent sessions
- Server-side time tracking
- Proper session lifecycle (active → completed/abandoned/expired)

---

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Practice Mode Flow**
   - Test configuration → instructions → exam → results
   - Verify immediate feedback works
   - Check retake functionality

2. **Test Mode Flow**
   - Verify time limit is required
   - Test timer enforcement
   - Verify no immediate feedback

3. **Recruitment/Competition Mode**
   - Test invitation token requirement
   - Verify direct-to-instructions redirect
   - Check linear navigation enforcement
   - Test anti-cheat features

4. **Route Protection**
   - Try accessing session page without active session
   - Try accessing results page with active session
   - Test redirects for expired/abandoned sessions
   - Verify concurrent session prevention

5. **Edge Cases**
   - Browser back/forward navigation
   - Page refresh during exam
   - Session expiry during exam
   - Network interruption recovery

---

## Migration Notes

### Old Architecture
- Single page with `ExamFlow` component
- All states managed in one component
- Conditional rendering for different phases

### New Architecture
- Four separate pages with dedicated routes
- State managed per page with proper transitions
- Server-side route protection
- Cleaner separation of concerns

### Deprecated Components
The old `ExamFlow` component in `src/components/exams/exam-flow.tsx` is no longer used by the main exam flow. It can be safely removed or kept for backwards compatibility if needed.
